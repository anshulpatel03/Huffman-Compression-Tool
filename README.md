# Huffman Encoding and Decoding

This program demonstrates Huffman encoding and decoding, a technique used for lossless data compression. It takes an input string, performs Huffman encoding to compress the data, and then decodes the encoded data to retrieve the original string.

## Overview

The code consists of the following components:

- `Huffman` class: Implements the Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms.
  - `encoder()`: Takes an input string, constructs the Huffman tree, and encodes the string.
  - `decoder()`: Takes an encoded string, decodes it using the Huffman tree, and retrieves the original string.

## Usage

1. Modify the `main()` function to provide the input string you want to encode and decode. For example, change `string s = "Hello";` to your desired input.

2. Compile and run the program.


3. The program will output the encoded string and the decoded string.
